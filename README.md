My solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 using python

## Files

Each day's solution is in it's own folder and contains:

    - 'test.txt': The input of the example given in the problem of the day, used to easily test the code
    - 'input.txt': The input for the actual problem of the day
    - 'Problem1.py': My solution in python to the first problem
    - 'Problem2.py': My solution in python to the second problem

## Output

Each python file returns only one value which is the solution to the problem of the day

## How to use

Launch the corresponding python file

'''bash
python .\DayX\ProblemN.py
'''

with X the day wanted, and N = 1 or 2
